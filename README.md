# Etch a Sketch

## Description
This is a simple Etch A Sketch project built as part of the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch).  
It allows users to draw on a dynamically generated grid using mouse interactions.

## Features
- Dynamic grid size selection (1x1 to 64x64).
- Left-click and drag to draw (currently only supports black color).
- Right-click and drag to erase.
- Uses **Flexbox** for layout instead of CSS Grid.

## How to Use
1. Enter a number (1-64) in the input field to set the grid size.
2. Click the "Set Grid" button to generate the grid.
3. **Left-click & drag** to draw.
4. **Right-click & drag** to erase.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS (**Flexbox** for layout)
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation, event listeners)

## Future Improvements
- Add color selection.
- Implement a "clear" button.
- Support touch interactions for mobile devices.
